Update 1: I am super tempted to just go right to the solution by googling it and figuring out someone else's logic tutorial-style. BUT that doesn't sound too fun, and they may go about it in a way that may have differed from what I could have originally thought of. I'll first sketch out the problem by dividing it in into sub-problems once I've identified desired outputs, etc.  
Update 2: One round of game on console completed ~ wooo! I littered the code with comments to get in the habit of thoroughly thinking things out. Surprised the OR operation didn't give me what I wanted in the first if statement, but AND did. Learning moments, I tell ya.
