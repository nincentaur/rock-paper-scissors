<u>ROCK PAPER SCISSORS (First Part)</u>
<br />
*Update 1*: I am super tempted to just go right to the solution by googling it and figuring out someone else's logic tutorial-style. BUT that doesn't sound fun, and they may go about it in a way that may have differed from what I could have originally thought of. I first sketched out the problem by dividing it in into sub-problems once I identified desired outputs, etc.  
*Update 2*: One round of game on console completed ~ wooo! I littered the code with comments to get in the habit of thoroughly thinking things out. Surprised the OR operation didn't give me what I wanted in the first if statement, but AND did. Learning moments, I tell ya.  
*Update 3*: There are so many possible ways to solve this that had I given to temptation to follow a tutorial I would have gotten quite frustrated because the tutorials on yt are not necessarily following TOP tasks/suggested steps. Also noticed that they were all meshing html and css together from the get-go, and seeing that I planned to just do the script today that woudn't work for me.  
Biggest lesson I learned today is that there are numerous ways to get to the desired result. So note to self... Follow the trail. If something doesn't work out, well, good thing you committed your last success to github.
